## Abstract:
The paper provides a comprehensive review of two different methods of classification for the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset. It investigates other factors that may effect the result along the way and compares two unique methods at each step of the way: pre-processing, data analysis and classification. The conclusion drawn from the paper is that the more complex Support Vector Machine provides a more successful model across all metric taken into account (accuracy, sensitivity and specificity). Toward the end of the paper there are conclusions about each of the methods taken and how in the future these could be improved.
